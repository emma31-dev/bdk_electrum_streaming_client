//! Defines parsed Electrum server notifications.
//!
//! This module provides the [`Notification`] enum, which categorizes incoming Electrum
//! notifications based on their method type. Currently supported variants include:
//!
//! - [`Notification::Header`] for `"blockchain.headers.subscribe"`
//! - [`Notification::ScriptHash`] for `"blockchain.scripthash.subscribe"`
//! - [`Notification::OutPoint`] for `"blockchain.outpoint.subscribe"`
//! - `Notification::SpSubscribe` for `"blockchain.silentpayments.subscribe"` (requires the `frigate` feature)
//! - [`Notification::Unknown`] for unrecognized or unsupported methods
//!
//! Each variant wraps a struct that contains the deserialized payload for that notification type.
//! Use [`Notification::new`] to construct a typed [`Notification`] from a raw JSON-RPC notification.
//!
//! This is useful for higher-level consumers who want to match against known server-side events.
